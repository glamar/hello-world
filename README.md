Hello Techies

My name is Getzie. I have loved programming since I was introduced to the computer world in high school many moons ago. I have spent the last few years learning how to set up Wordpress websites and basic coding using HTML and CSS. Now I'm ready to get more serious and learn all aspects of software engineering.

Can't wait to see what I can learn here at GitHub which I have heard so much about.
